title: "R Notebook"
output: html_notebook

Per Jonas's suggestion I will attempt to model no more than 8 variables simultaneously.

The eight variables Joanna and I chose in descending order of importance to keep in the model are:

HADS-A (drop first among anx measures?)
IES-R
FCR
Self Compassion
EAC
AAQc
CESD

# Read in the data and libraries



```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
