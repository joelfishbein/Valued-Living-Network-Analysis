# Valued-Living-Network-Analysis

**Purpose:** These scripts run analyses for the Valued Living RCT network intervention analysis.

**Structure**: All scripts are located within the folder titled [3 Syntax](/3%20Syntax/). The network models presented in the manuscript are run with [Estimate residualized change score models.Rmd](3%20Syntax/Network%20models/Estimate%20residualized%20change%20score%20models.Rmd). The /Standard Mediation Models/ folder contains scripts for running the parallel standard mediation models. /Tables/ generates various tables.
