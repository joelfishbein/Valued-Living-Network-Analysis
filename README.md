# Valued-Living-Network-Analysis

## Purpose
These scripts run analyses for the Valued Living RCT network intervention analysis.

## Structure 
All scripts are located within the folder titled [3 Syntax](/3%20Syntax/).

The network models presented in the manuscript are run with [Estimate residualized change score models.Rmd](3%20Syntax/Network%20models/Estimate%20residualized%20change%20score%20network%20models.Rmd).

The [Standard Mediation Models](/3%20Syntax/Standard%20Mediation%20Models) folder contains scripts for running the parallel standard mediation models.

Other folders contain scripts that provide other output or statistics, as labelled.

## For more information
Please contact the first author with any questions about use of the scripts.
